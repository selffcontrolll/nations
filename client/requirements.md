## Packages
react-simple-maps | Interactive SVG map components for the US map
d3-scale | Color scaling for map visualization
framer-motion | Smooth animations for UI elements and map transitions
lucide-react | Icons for the tactical interface
clsx | Utility for conditional classes

## Notes
The map will use `react-simple-maps` with a standard US topojson.
Polling will be used to fetch the simulation state every 1-2 seconds.
The design is retro-tactical: dark backgrounds, neon greens/reds, monospaced fonts.
